<b><center><h1>History</h1></b>
<p style="font-size: 120%">
The predecessor to what is now the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King was founded in on July 23,<br>
 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King. Inspired by the McDonald brothers' original store location<br>
  in San Bernardino, California, the founders and owners, Keith J. Cramer and his step father Matthew Burns, began <br>
  searching for a concept. After purchasing the rights to two pieces of equipment called "Insta" machines, the two <br>
  opened their first stores around a cooking device known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so <br>
  successful at cooking burgers, they required all of their franchises to carry the device. After the original <br>
  company began to falter in 1959, it was purchased by its Miami, Florida, franchisees James McLamore and David <br>
  R. Edgerton. The two initiated a corporate restructuring of the chain; the first step being to rename the <br>
  company Burger King. The duo ran the company as an independent entity for eight years, eventually expanding <br>
  to over 250 locations in the United States, when they sold it to the Pillsbury Company in 1967.

The Burger King Rebrand: Design Fit for a King?In the ongoing corporate quest to keep the crown, Burger King has<br> 
rebranded, serving up its first alternate look in more than two decades, while offering a logo that throws it back<br> 
 to the versions that were  in play in different form from 1969 to 1999.As the brand detailed in a release, “The<br> 
  announcement signals a commitment to digital-first expression and recent improvements to taste and food quality,<br> 
   through the removal of colors, flavors and preservatives from artificial sources from menu items, as well as<br> 
    an ambitious pledge to environmental sustainability.”The rebrand, featuring work by Jones Knowles Ritchie,<br> 
     is comprehensive—there’s the logo. Packaging. Merchandise. Menus. Uniforms. Signage and decor. Digital assets.<br>  
     “The result is a new look that indicates confidence in the future, while remaining true [to] heritage and what guests love about BK.”

 	Logo. Confidently, what BK is all about - real, simple and delicious food. Since launching the current logo<br> 
 	 in 1999, the industry has transitioned to a more modern, digital-friendly design language. The new minimalist<br> 
 	  logo seamlessly meets the brand evolution of the times and pays homage to the<br> 
    brand heritage with a refined design that’s confident, simple and fun.<br> 
Color: Selected colors are unapologetically rich and bold, inspired by the iconic <br> 
Burger King flame grilling process and fresh ingredients. The new photography is hyper<br> 
 textured and dials up the sensorial aspect of the food.<br> 
Font. Burger King new proprietary brand font is (appropriately) called “Flame”. The font is inspired by the shapes<br> 
 of BK food - rounded, bold, yummy - and brand’s irreverent personality.
